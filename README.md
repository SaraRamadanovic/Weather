# Weather
A simple weather app was created with the purpose of learning swift and iOS development, designing the UI interface, setting constraints and using libraries such as Alamofire, NVActivityIndicatorView and SwiftyJSON. Sometimes app faces an issue with location updating. Future plans: Bug fixes, weekly forecast and choosing the location.
